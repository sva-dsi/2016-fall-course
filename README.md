Welcome to the basic course repository for syllabus, slides, materials for Data Visualization Fall 2016, an SVA-DSI course.


### INSTRUCTOR:
Aurelia Moser

### DESCRIPTION

Data visualizations increasingly shape the way we process the success of initiatives, and the expectations for activism and innovation globally. How might you evaluate the success or impact of a program? What skills should you hone to communicate your projects and progress to a new audience? How can technology hone critical thinking and problem framing for a particular area of social need and interest? 

This course will introduce web development for data visualization, including an introduction to web scripting languages, version control for collaborative coding, and the authorship of interactive visualization on/off the web.
